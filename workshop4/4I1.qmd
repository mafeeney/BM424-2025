## Minutes from the last Emergency Pandemic Response Team Meeting {.unnumbered}

At the previous emergency pandemic response team meeting, the following action points were agreed:


* Interview the patients currently known to be infected with anthrax. Identify what variation of the infection they have (cutaneous, respiratory, etc.) 

* Post identification of source (food source, building, etc.) cut it off. In the case of a building, it should be shut immediately (condemned) and decontaminated. 

* Vaccination program. Encourage people to get vaccinated to minimise infection. 

* Hospital policy for disposal of bodies. No autopsy. 

* Investigate local farms and livestock. Testing the soil and the animals for the presence of the spores.
Vaccinate the animals and farm staff. (2)
Biochemical assays testing for catalase(+), oxidase(-). Gram positive rods. That are neg for haemolysis. (4)
