## Epidemiological Data

A team of scientists working together have cultured <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> from a number of patient sputum samples; isolated genomic DNA from these strains; sequenced this genomic DNA using an Illumina MiSeq platform; assembled the short paired-end reads; and compared these assemblies to the extant <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> sequences available in the NCBI databases. The results of these experiments are summarised in the table below.
