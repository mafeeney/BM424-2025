### Epidemiological Data {.unnumbered}

A team of scientists working together have in a PHS lab have isolated and cultured Group A Streptococcus species (following standard protocols) from a number of patient samples taken during this outbreak; isolated DNA from these cultures; sequenced this DNA using an Illumina MiSeq platform; assembled the short paired-end reads; and compared these assemblies to the extant Group A Streptococcus sequences available in the NCBI databases. The results of these experiments are summarised in the table below.
