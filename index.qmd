# Preface {.unnumbered}

These are materials for the workshop sessions on pandemic management and infectious disease control, presented as part of BM424 at the University of Strathclyde (SIPBS) in AY 2024-25. 

Each member of your group will play one of the following roles as you attempt to tackle the disease outbreak and save your city:

1.	Provost (head of the city council)
2.	Representative from a national public health org. (Public Health Scotland)
3.	Epidemiologist (on secondment from Public Health Scotland)
4.	Director of the city's main hospital (`r hospital_name`)
5.	City planner/civil servant
6.	Microbiologist (working in one of the NHS Scotland clinical labs)
7.	Public communications expert (past and current sci comm campaigns)
8.  Doctor at a major surgery in `r city_name`
9. Epidemiologist from the local university, an expert on <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> transmission

You must work together, using the information that has been provided for you in the attached information packets, and decide what action(s) should be taken to control the <i>Legionella</i> outbreak currently plaguing your city, `r city_name`. Your actions should be evidence-based â€“ use the peer-reviewed literature to decide on measures that will stop the pandemic in your scenario.

Your action points may include directives to gather more information (e.g., contact tracing of current cases, microbiological testing of food/water, etc.), or specific directives (e.g. public health measures, non-pharmaceutical interventions, etc.). Use the data/expertise of all group members. Be clear, concise, and specific.

You may choose to include mathematical modeling as part of your decision making (for example, using an [epidemic calculator](http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html) or other models); if you do so, you should provide details of your modelling and predictions when you submit your group's pro forma.

You should submit 3-5 specific actions to control the pandemic, using the [workshop 3 pro forma](../proformas/BM424_workshop3_proforma.docx) (also available on MyPlace). Submit this by noon, Friday March 1st, via the submission link on MyPlace.
