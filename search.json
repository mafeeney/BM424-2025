    "text": "0.1 Overview of workshop 3\nIn this workshop, you will work in groups to solve a scenario where a city has encountered a pandemic outbreak of disease. You will need to agree, as a group, on the actions you wish to take to limit the spread of the disease and mitigate the effects of the pandemic.\nIn the next workshop, you will be able to see what effect(s) your actions have had and further decide on the course(s) of action that your city should take.\n\n0.1.1 Roles and Responsibilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs a group, you should decide who will be responsible for which task(s) and how to allocate the work fairly. One possible way to divide the workload amongst your group is by choosing/allocating roles based on subject specialism, as outlined below. However, it is up to your group to decide on the best way to divide the work and a democratic process for making decisions.\n\n\nEach member of your group will play one of the following roles as you attempt to tackle the disease outbreak and save your city:\n\nProvost (head of the city council)\nRepresentative from a national public health org. (Public Health Scotland)\nEpidemiologist (on secondment from Public Health Scotland)\nDirector of the city’s main hospital\nCity planner/civil servant\nMicrobiologist (working in one of the NHS Scotland clinical labs)\nPublic communications expert (past and current sci comm campaigns)\nDoctor at a major surgery\nEpidemiologist from the local university with relevant expertise\n\n\n\n0.1.2 Emergency Pandemic Response Team Meeting\nYou must work together, using the information that has been provided for you in the attached information packets, and decide what action(s) should be taken to control the outbreak currently plaguing your city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYour actions should be evidence-based – use the peer-reviewed literature to decide on measures that will stop the pandemic in your scenario. What public health measures have previously been shown to work to contain similar outbreaks?\n\n\n\n\n0.1.3 Submit committee decisions\nYou should submit 3-5 specific actions that your city will take to try to control the pandemic, using the workshop 3 pro forma (available on MyPlace). Submit this by noon, Friday March 7th, via the submission link on MyPlace. (Only one member in each group needs to submit the pro forma - you should decide among yourselves who will do this.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYour action points may include directives to gather more information (e.g., contact tracing of current cases, microbiological testing of food/water, etc.), or specific directives (e.g. public health measures, non-pharmaceutical interventions, etc.). Use the data/expertise of all group members. Be clear, concise, and specific.",

Though yet to be formally confirmed as a pandemic, suspicions have intensified following a recent stunning surge in patients presenting with symptoms indicative of Legionellosis.\nLegionellosis is caused by Legionella pneumophila. It is typically transmitted through the inhalation of contaminated water droplets, such as those from air conditioning systems or hot tubs. Symptoms include fever, chills, cough, muscle aches, and headaches. Residents of Inverkeld experiencing any of these symptoms are advised to contact their GP or dial 111 for health advice.\nIn a press release, the director of the Queen Rose in Inverkeld noted a troubling uptick in individuals reporting symptoms consistent with those associated with Legionellosis. Concerns were first raised when the local GPs began reporting an unusual increase in patients with symptoms of Legionellosis. While investigations are still ongoing, the possibility of a pandemic outbreak hovers, prompting concern from health agencies.\nIn response to the expanding concerns, health officials have instigated several precautionary measures, and Inverkeld have convened an Emergency Pandemic Response Team, which will be meeting on 2025-02-28 and attempting to find solutions that will stop the spread of the pandemic in Inverkeld.\nThe First Minister assured residents that authorities are exploring every avenue in their efforts to safeguard public health, and furthermore urged residents to remain vigilant and cooperate with health directives from the Inverkeld City Council. A statement released by the First Minister’s office read: “Despite the lack of confirmation regarding an outbreak, we are treating this matter with the utmost gravity.”\nThe people in Inverkeld have already begun to dread the possibility of a pandemic; potential consequences such as school closures, economic repercussions, and strain on healthcare resources, have sparked apprehension among residents, underscoring the need for swift and decisive action.\nContact Information for Further Updates:\n\nMore information will be posted on the Inverkeld website as the situation develops: https://www.InverkeldCouncil.co.uk\nThe Inverkeld Emergency Pandemic Response Team can be contacted on +44 01224 3756 6106 or at pandemic_response@Inverkeld.co.uk\n\nAbout the Author:\nJudy Her is a health correspondent at the Inverkeld Express, specializing in public health and safety issues.She can be contacted at jh4761@InverkeldExpress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inverkeld city centre\n\n\nInverkeld was granted city status in 1886. Located near Castle Dunrobin, Inverkeld is noted for its annual folk festival featuring traditional music and dance. Major industries in the city include chemicals, automotive, and agriculture.\nInverkeld is well-served by public transport: there are 3 bus companies operating routes that cover the city and outlying areas, and road links to other major cities (the A40 to Ayr and the the A32 to Aberdeen.) Inverkeld is further connected to regional towns and villages by rail services from the Inverkeld railway station. Inverkeld is also served by Inverkeld Airport, which is 2 miles from the city centre and which offers daily flights to Munich, Madrid, and Bilbao.\nNotable buildings in the city include Inverkeld Castle, Inverkeld Cathedral, and Hawthorn Abbey. Inverkeld also has several museums and art galleries and a riverfront promenade. The Inverkeld jazz festival is held annually in August, and tourists also flock to Inverkeld to take wildlife watching tours in autumn. Inverkeld is also noted as a hub of local arts and culture, with Riverbend Hall and Crawford Comedy Club drawing in crowds for performances from local and international artists. The city is renowned for sports, with the Lions and Falcons teams representing the city for field hockey and cricket, respectively.\nSome of the key Inverkeld features are summarized in the list below.\n\nPublic Facilities/Community Amenities\n\nSchools:\n\n9 primary schools\n3 secondary schools\n1 college\n\nNurseries: 8\nCare Homes: 3\nRestaurants and Cafes: 53\nParks and Playgrounds: 14\nLibraries: 6\nGyms and Sports Facilities: 10\nPrisons: 1\nPolice and Fire Stations: 6\nSurgeries and pharmacies: 10\nHospital: the Queen Rose\n\nRefer to the “Data” tab for information about the city demographics, voting and polling data, and more information about the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse-coloured scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a group of Legionella pneumophila cells.

By analyzing data from various sources, including infection rates, health officials can implement targeted measures to curb the spread of the disease.\nDr. Nadiyya Salaz, a leading infectious disease specialist, explains, “Our approach to managing infectious disease relies on robust data analysis to identify hotspots and allocate resources efficiently. By understanding the patterns of transmission, we will be able to introduce interventions that are both successful and minimally disruptive.”\nFor example, recent data has shown that areas with higher SARS-CoV2 vaccination rates are experiencing significantly lower infection rates and hospitalizations. “Vaccination will be our most powerful tool for fighting most infectious diseases,” says Salaz. “The data clearly confirms for similar outbreaks that there is a correlation between implementation of public health measures and reduced severity of the disease. And, we now know that we can develop new vaccines when needed, both safely and effectively.”\nThese public health measures, such as quarantine measures, will be crucial while new vaccines or treatments are developed and rolled out. “These interventions are based on solid evidence,” notes Salaz. “They help to protect the vulnerable populations who might not yet be vaccinated or might have underlying health conditions.”\nThe public is encouraged to stay informed through reliable sources and adhere to guidelines issued by health authorities. “Trust in science and data is paramount,” concludes Salaz. “Together, we can navigate through this pandemic by making informed, sensible decisions.”\nCredits: Kyle Wilson has been writing for the Public Health and Peer Review for the past 4 years, with a primary focus on epidemiology. Kyle Wilson interviewed Nadiyya Salaz on Tuesday, 28/01/2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews/blog post #2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pandemic Apocalypse: Are We on the Brink of Collapse? –Badraan al-Ghani, senior health correspondent for The Journal 30 January 2025\nThe world is descending into chaos as a new pandemic hits Inverkeld. This unprecedented pandemic is coming right after COVID-19 and monkey pox, amongst other diseases, have already taken an outrageous toll on the citizens of Inverkeld and nearby cities. It seems like the situation is spiraling out of control. With infection rates skyrocketing and new, more deadly variants emerging, experts warn that we could be facing the end times.\nHospitals are soon going to be overwhelmed, unable to cope with the sheer volume of critically ill patients. “We’ve never seen anything like this,” says Dr. Dohn, a emergency room physician at the Queen Rose. “After years and years of harsh cuts to the NHS, we’re in a terrible state. We’re running out of PPE,, beds, and even basic medical supplies. It’s a nightmare scenario.”\nThe death toll is climbing at an alarming rate, with terrible projections suggesting that the virus could wipe out entire communities. “We’re losing this battle,” states Dr. Dohn. “Without immediate and drastic action, the situation will only get more hopeless.” It is by no means clear that Inverkeld will be able to contain the pandemic.\nPanic is spreading as quickly as the virus itself. People are stocking up on canned foods,, hoarding supplies, and fearing the worst. “I’ve never been so scared in my life as I was during the COVID lockdowns,” says Maya Heath, a mother of two. “It brings it all back. We don’t know what tomorrow will bring. Every day is a struggle for survival.”\nThe future looks bleak, with no end in sight. “This is just the beginning,” warns Dr. Dohn. “The pathogen is mutating, making it harder to control. We’ll be in for a long, dark spring.” Other experts have noted that due to global warming, pandemics are likely to occur more frequently and be more severe in a warming world.\nAs fear and uncertainty grip the world, one thing is clear: we must prepare for the worst. The pandemic apocalypse is upon us, and there is no turning back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews/blog post #3\n\n\n\n\n\nExposing the Vaccine Lie: What They’re Not Telling You - Dylan Spangler - 31 January 2025 Published in: Freedom Health Blog\nWake up, people! There’s a new “pandemic” in Inverkeld. This one is supposedly due to something called Legionella pneumophila (according to something the “experts” call “germ theory” and which has been proven to be another Big Fat Lie.)\nThe so-called “scamdemic” is nothing but a ploy by the government and Big Pharma to control your lives and make billions off their poisonous vaccines. Don’t be fooled by their lies tactics!\nFirst off, the virus is a complete fabrication. The numbers are inflated to scare you into compliance. Have you noticed how quickly they came up with new “COVID” “variants” every time people started questioning their narrative? The new pandemic in Inverkeld is just more of the same. It’s all a big lie to keep you in fear and under control.\nAnd the vaccines? Don’t even get me started. They’re filled with harmful chemicals and rushed ingredients that have never been tested long-term. What even is this SO-CALLED ribonucleic acid? Why do you think they’re pushing so hard to get everyone jabbed? It’s not about your health, it’s about making money and keeping you obedient.\nPeople who’ve taken the vaccine are reporting all kinds of side effects, but the media won’t tell you that. They’re in on it too! Censorship is rampant, and anyone who dares to speak the truth is silenced. Ask yourself why they’re so desperate to shut down any dissenting voices.\nHerbal remedies is the way to go. Boost your immune system with vitamins, a healthy diet, and regular exercise. Don’t let them inject you with their toxic concoctions. Do your own research and think for yourself. The truth is out there if you look beyond the mainstream propaganda.\nDon’t be a sheep. Stand up for your rights and say no to the vaccine scam. Your health and freedom depend on it!\n[Keep watching this space - we’ll keep you informed on all the latest health news and help keep you healthy! Coming up next week - challenging the narrative on herd immunity!]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPandemic Report\nBriefing:\n\nBased on collated hospital reports and death certificates, it is believed that there have been 25 deaths due to Legionellosis in Inverkeld thus far\nThere are currently 462 patients in the Queen Rose with confirmed Legionellosis, or symptoms consistent with Legionellosis\nThere are currently 16 patients currently in the ICU with confirmed Legionellosis\n\n\n\nCity Demographics, Polling, and Budget\nThe current population of Inverkeld (as of December 2022) is 155564.

Though yet to be formally confirmed as a pandemic, suspicions have intensified following a recent frightening surge in patients presenting with symptoms indicative of influenza.\nInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is caused by influenza viruses. It spreads through respiratory droplets produced when infected individuals cough, sneeze, or talk. Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue. Residents of Baltyre experiencing any of these symptoms are advised to contact their GP or dial 111 for health advice.\nIn a press release, the director of the Queen’s College in Baltyre noted a shocking uptick in individuals reporting symptoms consistent with those associated with influenza. Fears were first raised when the local GPs began reporting an unusual increase in patients with symptoms of influenza. While investigations are still ongoing, the possibility of a pandemic outbreak emerges as a major concern, prompting concern from health agencies.\nIn response to the increasing concerns, health officials have launched several contingency plans, and Baltyre have convened an Emergency Pandemic Response Team, which will be meeting on 2025-02-28 and attempting to find solutions that will stop the spread of the pandemic in Baltyre.\nThe First Minister assured residents that authorities are leaving no option unexplored in their efforts to safeguard public health, and furthermore urged residents to remain vigilant and cooperate with health directives from the Baltyre City Council. A statement released by the First Minister’s office read: “While there is no confirmation of an outbreak at this time, we are taking this situation very seriously.”\nThe people in Baltyre have already begun to weigh the possibility of a pandemic; potential consequences such as school closures, economic repercussions, and strain on healthcare resources, have sparked apprehension among residents, underscoring the need for swift and decisive action.\nContact Information for Further Updates:\n\nMore information will be posted on the Baltyre website as the situation develops: https://www.BaltyreCouncil.co.uk\nThe Baltyre Emergency Pandemic Response Team can be contacted on +44 01343 6438 1078 or at pandemic_response@Baltyre.co.uk\n\nAbout the Author:\nRuwaida al-Hashim is a health correspondent at the Baltyre Times, specializing in public health and safety issues.She can be contacted at ra3127@BaltyreTimes.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Baltyre city centre\n\n\nBaltyre was granted city status in 1971. Located near Ailsa Falls, Baltyre is noted for its beautiful rose gardens and annual flower shows. Major industries in the city include chemicals, food and beverage, and agriculture.\nBaltyre is well-served by public transport: there are 3 bus companies operating routes that cover the city and outlying areas, and road links to other major cities (the A67 to Kilmarnock and the the A86 to Motherwell.) Baltyre is further connected to regional towns and villages by rail services from the Baltyre railway station. Baltyre is also served by Baltyre Airport, which is 8 miles from the city centre and which offers daily flights to Milan, Stockholm, and Valencia.\nNotable buildings in the city include Baltyre Castle, Baltyre Cathedral, and Dunrobin House. Baltyre also has a number of parks and green spaces and several biking and walking trails. The Baltyre heritage festival is held annually in April, and tourists also flock to Baltyre to take city ghost tours in summer. Baltyre is also noted as a hub of local arts and culture, with Parkside Hall and The Globe and Gale drawing in crowds for performances from local and international artists. The city is renowned for sports, with the Blues and Hornets teams representing the city for football and cricket, respectively.\nSome of the key Baltyre features are summarized in the list below.\n\nPublic Facilities/Community Amenities\n\nSchools:\n\n10 primary schools\n2 secondary schools\n1 college\n\nNurseries: 19\nCare Homes: 2\nRestaurants and Cafes: 139\nParks and Playgrounds: 3\nLibraries: 6\nGyms and Sports Facilities: 11\nPrisons: 2\nPolice and Fire Stations: 4\nSurgeries and pharmacies: 6\nHospital: the Queen’s College\n\nRefer to the “Data” tab for information about the city demographics, voting and polling data, and more information about the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse-coloured transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of an influenza virus particle.

By analyzing data from various sources, including vaccination coverage, health officials can implement targeted measures to curb the spread of the disease.\nDr. Angelique Mercado, a leading epidemiologist, explains, “Our approach to managing infectious disease relies on robust data analysis to identify hotspots and allocate resources efficiently. By understanding the patterns of transmission, we will be able to introduce interventions that are both effective and minimally disruptive.”\nFor example, recent data has shown that areas with higher SARS-CoV2 vaccination rates are experiencing significantly lower infection rates and hospitalizations. “Vaccination will be our most powerful tool for fighting most infectious diseases,” says Mercado. “The data clearly reinforces for similar outbreaks that there is a correlation between implementation of public health measures and reduced severity of the disease. And, we now know that we can develop new vaccines when needed, both safely and effectively.”\nThese public health measures, such as social distancing, will be crucial while new vaccines or treatments are developed and rolled out. “These interventions are based on solid evidence,” notes Mercado. “They help to protect the vulnerable populations who might not yet be vaccinated or might have underlying health conditions.”\nThe public is encouraged to stay informed through reliable sources and adhere to guidelines issued by health authorities. “Scientific evidence is our best guide,” concludes Mercado. “Together, we can navigate through this pandemic by making informed, sensible decisions.”\nCredits: Haafil el-Aly has been writing for the The Daily Medical Digest for the past 10 years, with a primary focus on public health. Haafil el-Aly interviewed Angelique Mercado on Tuesday, 28/01/2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews/blog post #2\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd Times: The Catastrophic Impact of the Pandemic –Zachary Loera Soto, senior health correspondent for The Sentinel 31 January 2025\nThe world is spiraling out of control as a new pandemic hits Baltyre. This horrific pandemic is coming right after COVID-19 and monkey pox, amongst other diseases, have already taken an outrageous toll on the citizens of Baltyre and nearby cities. It seems like the situation is spiraling out of control. With infection rates skyrocketing and new, more deadly variants emerging, experts warn that we could be facing the end times.\nHospitals are soon going to be overwhelmed, unable to cope with the sheer volume of critically ill patients. “We’ve never seen anything like this,” says Dr. France, a critical care specialist at the Queen’s College. “After years and years of harsh cuts to the NHS, we’re in a terrible state. We’re running out of ventilators,, PPE, and even basic medical supplies. It’s a catastrophe scenario.”\nThe death toll is climbing at an alarming rate, with terrible projections suggesting that the death toll could double. “We’re losing this battle,” states Dr. France. “Without immediate and drastic action, the situation will only get more dire.” It is by no means clear that Baltyre will be able to contain the pandemic.\nPanic is spreading as quickly as the virus itself. People are stocking up on canned foods,, stockpiling PPE, and fearing the worst. “I’ve never been so scared in my life as I was during the COVID lockdowns,” says Noel el-Lodi, a mother of two. “It brings it all back. We don’t know what tomorrow will bring. Every day is a constant state of fear.”\nThe future looks gloomy, with no end in sight. “This is just the beginning,” warns Dr. France. “The pathogen is becoming more aggressive, making it harder to control. We’ll be in for a long, dark spring.” Other experts have noted that due to global warming, pandemics are likely to occur more frequently and be more severe in a warming world.\nAs fear and uncertainty grip the world, one thing is clear: we must prepare for the worst. The pandemic apocalypse is upon us, and there is no turning back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews/blog post #3\n\n\n\n\n\nThink for Yourself: The Real Risks of the Vaccine - Aaron Hayes - 29 January 2025 Published in: Natural Health Warriors\nHold on to your hats! There’s a new “pandemic” in Baltyre. This one is supposedly due to something called Alphainfluenzavirus influenzae (according to something the “experts” call “germ theory” and which has been proven to be another Big Fat Lie.)\nThe so-called “pandemic hoax” is nothing but a ploy by the government and Big Pharma to manipulate the masses and make billions off their poisonous vaccines. Don’t be fooled by their fearmongering tactics!\nFirst off, the virus is a complete fabrication. The numbers are inflated to scare you into compliance. Have you noticed how quickly they came up with new “COVID” “variants” every time people started questioning their narrative? The new pandemic in Baltyre is just more of the same. It’s all a big lie to keep you in fear and under control.\nAnd the vaccines? Don’t even get me started. They’re filled with harmful chemicals and experimental ingredients that have never been tested long-term. What even is this SO-CALLED ribonucleic acid? Why do you think they’re pushing so hard to get everyone jabbed? It’s not about your health, it’s about making money and keeping you obedient.\nPeople who’ve taken the vaccine are reporting dangerous reactions, but the media won’t tell you that. They’re in on it too! Censorship is rampant, and anyone who dares to speak the truth is silenced. Ask yourself why they’re so desperate to shut down any dissenting voices.\nHealthy lifestyle is the way to go. Boost your immune system with vitamins, a healthy diet, and regular exercise. Don’t let them inject you with their toxic concoctions. Do your own research and think for yourself. The truth is out there if you look beyond the mainstream propaganda.\nDon’t be a sheep. Stand up for your rights and say no to the vaccine scam. Your health and freedom depend on it!\n[Keep watching this space - we’ll keep you informed on all the latest health news and help keep you healthy! Coming up next week - an examination of the link between vaccines and chronic illness!]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPandemic Report\nBriefing:\n\nBased on collated hospital reports and death certificates, it is believed that there have been 26 deaths due to influenza in Baltyre thus far\nThere are currently 534 patients in the Queen’s College with confirmed influenza, or symptoms consistent with influenza\nThere are currently 13 patients currently in the ICU with confirmed influenza\n\n\n\nCity Demographics, Polling, and Budget\nThe current population of Baltyre (as of December 2022) is 166895.
