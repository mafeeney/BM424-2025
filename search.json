    "text": "Overview of workshop 3\nIn this workshop, you will work in groups to solve a scenario where a city has encountered a pandemic outbreak of disease. You will need to agree, as a group, on the actions you wish to take to limit the spread of the disease and mitigate the effects of the pandemic.\nIn the next workshop, you will be able to see what effect(s) your actions have had and further decide on the course(s) of action that your city should take.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs a group, you should decide who will be responsible for which task(s) and how to allocate the work fairly. One possible way to divide the workload amongst your group is by choosing/allocating roles based on subject specialism, as outlined below. However, it is up to your group to decide on the best way to divide the work and a democratic process for making decisions.\n\n\nEach member of your group will play one of the following roles as you attempt to tackle the disease outbreak and save your city:\n\nProvost (head of the city council)\nRepresentative from a national public health org. (Public Health Scotland)\nEpidemiologist (on secondment from Public Health Scotland)\nDirector of the city’s main hospital\nCity planner/civil servant\nMicrobiologist (working in one of the NHS Scotland clinical labs)\nPublic communications expert (past and current sci comm campaigns)\nDoctor at a major surgery\nEpidemiologist from the local university wiht relevant expertise\n\n\n\nEmergency Pandemic Response Team Meeting\nYou must work together, using the information that has been provided for you in the attached information packets, and decide what action(s) should be taken to control the outbreak currently plaguing your city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYour actions should be evidence-based – use the peer-reviewed literature to decide on measures that will stop the pandemic in your scenario. What public health measures have previously been shown to work to contain similar outbreaks?\n\n\n\n\nSubmit committee decisions\nYou should submit 3-5 specific actions that your city will take to try to control the pandemic, using the workshop 3 pro forma (available on MyPlace). Submit this by noon, Friday March 7th, via the submission link on MyPlace. (Only one member in each group needs to submit the pro forma - you should decide among yourselves who will do this.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYour action points may include directives to gather more information (e.g., contact tracing of current cases, microbiological testing of food/water, etc.), or specific directives (e.g. public health measures, non-pharmaceutical interventions, etc.). Use the data/expertise of all group members. Be clear, concise, and specific.",

    "text": "Pandemic OutbreakInverkeldLegionella pneumophilaPublic Opinion: News and E-mails\n\n\n\nInverkeld Express\n\nBreaking News\nFears Over Possible Outbreak of Legionellosis in Inverkeld\n24 February, 2025\nAnxiety is rising in Inverkeld as health officials investigate a potential outbreak of Legionellosis, raising alarm bells across the region. Though yet to be formally confirmed as a pandemic, suspicions have intensified following a recent stunning surge in patients presenting with symptoms indicative of Legionellosis.\nLegionellosis is caused by Legionella pneumophila. It is typically transmitted through the inhalation of contaminated water droplets, such as those from air conditioning systems or hot tubs. Symptoms include fever, chills, cough, muscle aches, and headaches. Residents of Inverkeld experiencing any of these symptoms are advised to contact their GP or dial 111 for health advice.\nIn a press release, the director of the Queen Rose in Inverkeld noted a troubling uptick in individuals reporting symptoms consistent with those associated with Legionellosis. Concerns were first raised when the local GPs began reporting an unusual increase in patients with symptoms of Legionellosis. While investigations are still ongoing, the possibility of a pandemic outbreak hovers, prompting concern from health agencies.\nIn response to the expanding concerns, health officials have instigated several precautionary measures, and Inverkeld have convened an Emergency Pandemic Response Team, which will be meeting on 2025-02-28 and attempting to find solutions that will stop the spread of the pandemic in Inverkeld.\nThe First Minister assured residents that authorities are leaving exploring every avenue in their efforts to safeguard public health, and furthermore urged residents to remain vigilant and cooperate with health directives from the Inverkeld City Council. A statement released by the First Minister’s office read: “Despite the lack of confirmation regarding an outbreak, we are treating this matter with the utmost gravity.”\nThe people in Inverkeld have already begun to dread the possibility of a pandemic; potential consequences such as school closures, economic repercussions, and strain on healthcare resources, have sparked apprehension among residents, underscoring the need for swift and decisive action.\nContact Information for Further Updates:\n\nMore information will be posted on the Inverkeld website as the situation develops: https://www.InverkeldCouncil.co.uk\nThe Inverkeld Emergency Pandemic Response Team can be contacted on +44 01224 3756 6106 or at pandemic_response@Inverkeld.co.uk\n\nAbout the Author:\nJudy Her is a health correspondent at the Inverkeld Express, specializing in public health and safety issues.She can be contacted at jh4761@InverkeldExpress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inverkeld city centre\n\n\nInverkeld was granted city status in 1886. Located near Castle Dunrobin, Inverkeld is noted for its annual folk festival featuring traditional music and dance. Major industries in the city include chemicals, automotive, and agriculture.\nInverkeld is well-served by public transport: there are 3 bus companies operating routes that cover the city and outlying areas, and road links to other major cities (the A40 to Ayr and the the A32 to Aberdeen.) Inverkeld is further connected to regional towns and villages by rail services from the Inverkeld railway station. Inverkeld is also served by Inverkeld Airport, which is 2 miles from the city centre and which offers daily flights to Munich, Madrid, and Bilbao.\nNotable buildings in the city include Inverkeld Castle, Inverkeld Cathedral, and Hawthorn Abbey. Inverkeld also has several museums and art galleries and a riverfront promenade. The Inverkeld jazz festival is held annually in August, and tourists also flock to Inverkeld to take wildlife watching tours in autumn. Inverkeld is also noted as a hub of local arts and culture, with Riverbend Hall and Crawford Comedy Club drawing in crowds for performances from local and international artists. The city is renowned for sports, with the Lions and Falcons teams representing the city for field hockey and cricket, respectively.\nSome of the key Inverkeld features are summarized in the list below.\n\nPublic Facilities/Community Amenities\n\nSchools:\n\n9 primary schools\n3 secondary schools\n1 college\n\nNurseries: 8\nCare Homes: 3\nRestaurants and Cafes: 53\nParks and Playgrounds: 14\nLibraries: 6\nGyms and Sports Facilities: 10\nPrisons: 1\nPolice and Fire Stations: 6\nSurgeries and pharmacies: 10\nHospital: the Queen Rose\n\nRefer to the “Data” tab for information about the city demographics, voting and polling data, and more information about the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse-coloured scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a group of Legionella pneumophila cells.
