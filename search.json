One possible way to divide the workload amongst your group is by choosing/allocating roles based on subject specialism, as outlined below. However, it is up to your group to decide on the best way to divide the work and a democratic process for making decisions.\n\n\nEach member of your group will play one of the following roles as you attempt to tackle the disease outbreak and save your city:\n\nProvost (head of the city council)\nRepresentative from a national public health org. (Public Health Scotland)\nEpidemiologist (on secondment from Public Health Scotland)\nDirector of the city’s main hospital\nCity planner/civil servant\nMicrobiologist (working in one of the NHS Scotland clinical labs)\nPublic communications expert (past and current sci comm campaigns)\nDoctor at a major surgery\nEpidemiologist from the local university wiht relevant expertise\n\n\n\nEmergency Pandemic Response Team Meeting\nYou must work together, using the information that has been provided for you in the attached information packets, and decide what action(s) should be taken to control the outbreak currently plaguing your city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYour actions should be evidence-based – use the peer-reviewed literature to decide on measures that will stop the pandemic in your scenario. What public health measures have previously been shown to work to contain similar outbreaks?\n\n\n\n\nSubmit committee decisions\nYou should submit 3-5 specific actions that your city will take to try to control the pandemic, using the workshop 3 pro forma (available on MyPlace). Submit this by noon, Friday March 7th, via the submission link on MyPlace. (Only one member in each group needs to submit the pro forma - you should decide among yourselves who will do this.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYour action points may include directives to gather more information (e.g., contact tracing of current cases, microbiological testing of food/water, etc.), or specific directives (e.g. public health measures, non-pharmaceutical interventions, etc.).

Though yet to be formally confirmed as a pandemic, suspicions have intensified following a recent concerning surge in patients presenting with symptoms indicative of Legionellosis.\nLegionellosis is caused by Legionella pneumophila. It is typically transmitted through the inhalation of contaminated water droplets, such as those from air conditioning systems or hot tubs. Symptoms include fever, chills, cough, muscle aches, and headaches. Residents of Inverkeld experiencing any of these symptoms are advised to contact their GP or dial 111 for health advice.\nIn a press release, the director of the Queen Rose in Inverkeld noted a distressing uptick in individuals reporting symptoms consistent with those associated with Legionellosis. Anxieties were first raised when the local GPs began reporting an unusual increase in patients with symptoms of Legionellosis. While investigations are still ongoing, the possibility of a pandemic outbreak shadows the community, prompting concern from health agencies.\nIn response to the escalating concerns, health officials have activated several preventive actions, and Inverkeld have convened an Emergency Pandemic Response Team, which will be meeting on 2025-02-28 and attempting to find solutions that will stop the spread of the pandemic in Inverkeld.\nThe First Minister assured residents that authorities are leaving exploring every avenue in their efforts to safeguard public health, and furthermore urged residents to remain vigilant and cooperate with health directives from the Inverkeld City Council. A statement released by the First Minister’s office read: “While there is no confirmation of an outbreak at this time, we are taking this situation very seriously.”\nThe people in Inverkeld have already begun to consider the possibility of a pandemic; potential consequences such as school closures, economic repercussions, and strain on healthcare resources, have sparked apprehension among residents, underscoring the need for swift and decisive action.\nContact Information for Further Updates:\n\nMore information will be posted on the Inverkeld website as the situation develops: https://www.InverkeldCouncil.co.uk\nThe Inverkeld Emergency Pandemic Response Team can be contacted on +44 01786 3091 7139 or at pandemic_response@Inverkeld.co.uk\n\nAbout the Author:\nGerardo Sanabria is a health correspondent at the Inverkeld Sentinel, specializing in public health and safety issues.He can be contacted at gs8322@InverkeldSentinel.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inverkeld city centre\n\n\nInverkeld was granted city status in 1956. Located near Castle Kincardine, Inverkeld is noted for its rich maritime history. Major industries in the city include pharmaceuticals, retail, and agriculture.\nInverkeld is well-served by public transport: there are 3 bus companies operating routes that cover the city and outlying areas, and road links to other major cities (the A75 to Falkirk and the the A30 to Dumfries.) Inverkeld is further connected to regional towns and villages by rail services from the Inverkeld railway station. Inverkeld is also served by Inverkeld Airport, which is 8 miles from the city centre and which offers daily flights to Florence, Nice, and Düsseldorf.\nNotable buildings in the city include Inverkeld Castle, Inverkeld Cathedral, and Braeside Institute. Inverkeld also has a number of historic landmarks and several historic monuments. The Inverkeld jazz festival is held annually in May, and tourists also flock to Inverkeld to sample the local cuisine in autumn. Inverkeld is also noted as a hub of local arts and culture, with Stewart Hall and The Globe and Gale drawing in crowds for performances from local and international artists. The city is renowned for sports, with the Bluebirds and Hornets teams representing the city for field hockey and cricket, respectively.\nSome of the key Inverkeld features are summarized in the list below.\n\nPublic Facilities/Community Amenities\n\nSchools:\n\n5 primary schools\n6 secondary schools\n1 college\n\nNurseries: 8\nCare Homes: 4\nRestaurants and Cafes: 103\nParks and Playgrounds: 5\nLibraries: 4\nGyms and Sports Facilities: 9\nPrisons: 2\nPolice and Fire Stations: 6\nSurgeries and pharmacies: 13\nHospital: the Queen Rose\n\nRefer to the “Data” tab for information about the city demographics, voting and polling data, and more information about the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse-coloured scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a group of Legionella pneumophila cells.

By analyzing data from various sources, including vaccination coverage, health officials can implement targeted measures to curb the spread of the disease.\nDr. Aundrea Irvin, a leading health policy analyst, explains, “Our approach relies on robust data analysis to identify hotspots and allocate resources efficiently. By understanding the patterns of transmission, we will be able to introduce interventions that are both successful and minimally disruptive.”\nRecent data has shown that areas with higher vaccination rates are experiencing significantly lower infection rates and hospitalizations. “Vaccination will be our most powerful tool,” says Irvin. “The data clearly reinforces for similar outbreaks that there is a correlation between implementation of public health measures and reduced severity of the disease.”\nThese public health measures, such as mask mandates, will be crucial while new vaccines or treatments are developed and rolled out. “These interventions are based on solid evidence,” notes Irvin. “They help to protect the vulnerable populations who might not yet be vaccinated or might have underlying health conditions.”\nThe public is encouraged to stay informed through reliable sources and adhere to guidelines issued by health authorities. “Scientific evidence is our best guide,” concludes Irvin. “Together, we can navigate through this pandemic by making informed, sensible decisions.”\nCredits: Antatenique Becerra has been writing for the The Health Gazette for the past 4 years, with a primary focus on infectious diseases. Antatenique Becerra interviewed Aundrea Irvin on Tuesday, 28/01/2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews/blog post #2\n\n\n\n\n\nChaos Unleashed: The Terrifying Future of the Pandemic –Camille Wesley, senior health correspondent for The Daily Times 29 January 2025\nThe world is spiraling out of control as a new pandemic hits Inverkeld. This catastrophic pandemic is coming right after COVID-19 and monkey pox, amongst other diseases, have already taken an outrageous toll on the citizens of Inverkeld and nearby cities. It seems like the situation is spiraling out of control. With infection rates skyrocketing and new, more deadly variants emerging, experts warn that we could be facing the end days.\nHospitals are soon going to be overwhelmed, unable to cope with the sheer volume of critically ill patients. “We’ve never seen anything like this,” says Dr. Ramirez-Cabrera, a critical care specialist at the Queen Rose. “After years and years of harsh cuts to the NHS, we’re in a terrible state. We’re running out of beds,, oxygen, and even basic medical supplies. It’s a disaster scenario.”\nThe death toll is climbing at an alarming rate, with dreary projections suggesting that the pandemic could last for years. “We’re losing this battle,” states Dr. Ramirez-Cabrera. “Without immediate and drastic action, the situation will only get more critical.” It is by no means clear that Inverkeld will be able to contain the pandemic.\nPanic is spreading as quickly as the virus itself. People are hoarding supplies,, stockpiling PPE, and fearing the worst. “I’ve never been so scared in my life as I was during the COVID lockdowns,” says Minnah Meza, a mother of three. “It brings it all back. We don’t know what tomorrow will bring. Every day is a fight for our lives.”\nThe future looks grim, with no end in sight. “This is just the beginning,” warns Dr. Ramirez-Cabrera. “The pathogen is mutating, making it harder to control. We’ll be in for a long, dark spring.” Other experts have noted that due to global warming, pandemics are likely to occur more frequently and be more severe in a warming world.\nAs fear and uncertainty grip the world, one thing is clear: we must prepare for the worst. The pandemic apocalypse is upon us, and there is no turning back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews/blog post #3\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Truth About Vaccines: What the Government Doesn’t Want You to Know - Christopher Chagolla - 29 January 2025 Published in: The Truth Exposed\nBrace yourselves! There’s a new “pandemic” in Inverkeld. This one is supposedly due to something called Legionella pneumophila (according to something the “experts” call “germ theory” and which has been proven to be another Big Fat Lie.)\nThe so-called “plandemic” is nothing but a ploy by the government and Big Pharma to force compliance and make billions off their poisonous vaccines. Don’t be fooled by their fearmongering tactics!\nFirst off, the virus is a complete fabrication. The numbers are inflated to scare you into compliance. Have you noticed how quickly they came up with new “COVID” “variants” every time people started questioning their narrative? The new pandemic in Inverkeld is just more of the same. It’s all a big lie to keep you in fear and under control.\nAnd the vaccines? Don’t even get me started. They’re filled with dangerous compounds and untested ingredients that have never been tested long-term. What even is this SO-CALLED ribonucleic acid? Why do you think they’re pushing so hard to get everyone jabbed? It’s not about your health, it’s about making money and keeping you obedient.\nPeople who’ve taken the vaccine are reporting serious health issues, but the media won’t tell you that. They’re in on it too! Censorship is rampant, and anyone who dares to speak the truth is silenced. Ask yourself why they’re so desperate to shut down any dissenting voices.\nHerbal remedies is the way to go. Boost your immune system with vitamins, a healthy diet, and regular exercise. Don’t let them inject you with their toxic concoctions. Do your own research and think for yourself. The truth is out there if you look beyond the mainstream propaganda.\nDon’t be a sheep. Stand up for your rights and say no to the vaccine scam. Your health and freedom depend on it!\n[Keep watching this space - we’ll keep you informed on all the latest health news and help keep you healthy! Coming up next week - challenging the narrative on herd immunity!]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCity Demographics, Polling, and Budget\nThe current population of Inverkeld (as of December 2022) is 155373.

Similarly, antibiotic stewardship programs are essential for optimizing the use of antimicrobials, thereby reducing the risk of resistance and ensuring effective treatments for future generations.\n\nThere was 1 fewer hospital-acquired MRSA infection in 2025 than there were in 2024.\nThere were 4 more hospital-acquired Clostridiodes difficile infections in 2025 than there were in 2024.\nThere were 5 fewer hospital-acquired Candida auris infections in 2025 than there were in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nlist(\n  icon = ifelse(mrsa2&lt;mrsa1, \"arrow-down-right\", \"arrow-up-right\"), \n  color = ifelse(mrsa2&lt;mrsa1, \"success\", \"danger\"), \n  value = mrsa2\n)\n\n$icon\n[1] \"arrow-down-right\"\n\n$color\n[1] \"success\"\n\n$value\n[1] 6\n\n\n\nlist(\n  icon = ifelse(Cdiff2&lt;Cdiff1, \"arrow-down-right\", \"arrow-up-right\"), \n  color = ifelse(Cdiff2&lt;Cdiff1, \"success\", \"danger\"), \n  value = Cdiff2\n)\n\n$icon\n[1] \"arrow-up-right\"\n\n$color\n[1] \"danger\"\n\n$value\n[1] 8\n\n\n\nlist(\n  icon = ifelse(Cauris2&lt;Cauris1, \"arrow-down-right\", \"arrow-up-right\"), \n  color = ifelse(Cauris2&lt;Cauris1, \"success\", \"danger\"), \n  value = Cauris2\n)\n\n$icon\n[1] \"arrow-down-right\"\n\n$color\n[1] \"success\"\n\n$value\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n\n\nlist(\n  icon = \"prescription\",\n  color = ifelse(app_therapy &gt; 95, \"success\", \"warning\"),\n  value = app_therapy\n)\n\n$icon\n[1] \"prescription\"\n\n$color\n[1] \"warning\"\n\n$value\n[1] 82\n\n\n\nlist(\n  icon = \"capsule-pill\",\n  color = ifelse(desc &gt; 15, \"success\", \"warning\"),\n  value = desc\n)\n\n$icon\n[1] \"capsule-pill\"\n\n$color\n[1] \"warning\"\n\n$value\n[1] 13\n\n\n\nlist(\n  icon = \"exclamation-diamond\",\n  color = ifelse(amr_rate &gt; 50, \"success\", \"warning\"),\n  value = amr_rate\n)\n\n$icon\n[1] \"exclamation-diamond\"\n\n$color\n[1] \"warning\"\n\n$value\n[1] 47\n\n\n\nCommunity Health Data\n\n\n\n\nThe Queen Rose monitors the prevalence of COVID-19 and other viruses in the community to ensure they are prepared for potential surges in patient admissions, enabling them to allocate resources and staff efficiently. By tracking these trends, the hospital can implement timely public health interventions and provide accurate information to the community to mitigate the spread of infections. Additionally, continuous monitoring helps in identifying emerging outbreaks early, allowing for a rapid response that minimizes the impact on public health and healthcare services.\n\nThere were 18 fewer COVID-19 cases this week than in the previous week.\nWe are seeing an increase in infections caused by other respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus, RSV).\n\n\n\n\n\nlist(\n  icon = \"virus\",\n  color = ifelse(covid2&lt;covid1, \"success\", \"danger\"),\n  value = covid1\n)\n\n$icon\n[1] \"virus\"\n\n$color\n[1] \"danger\"\n\n$value\n[1] 91\n\n\n\nlist(\n  icon = \"virus2\",\n  color = ifelse(virus2&lt;virus1, \"success\", \"danger\"),\n  value = virus1\n)\n\n$icon\n[1] \"virus2\"\n\n$color\n[1] \"danger\"\n\n$value\n[1] 78\n\n\n\n\n\nlist(\n  icon = \"clipboard2-pulse\",\n  color = \"success\",\n  value = covid_vacc\n)\n\n$icon\n[1] \"clipboard2-pulse\"\n\n$color\n[1] \"success\"\n\n$value\n[1] 75\n\n\n\nlist(\n  icon = \"clipboard2-pulse\",\n  color = \"warning\",\n  value = vacc_rate\n)\n\n$icon\n[1] \"clipboard2-pulse\"\n\n$color\n[1] \"warning\"\n\n$value\n[1] 93\n\n\n\nEpidemiological Data\n\n\n\n\nCity Pandemic Planning Resources\n\nStanding Committee on Pandemic Preparedness\nUK Pandemic Preparedness plan\nCOVID-19 health protection guidance released by Public Health Scotland\nTackling antimicrobial resistance 2019–2024: The UK’s five-year national action plan\nUK One Health Report - Joint report on antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance, 2013–2017\nScottish One Health Antimicrobial Use and Antimicrobial Resistance in 2021\nCommunicating risk in public health emergencies: A WHO guideline for emergency risk communication (ERC) policy and practice\n\n\n\nHospital Pandemic Preparedness and Planning\n\nNational Infection Prevention and Control Manual.\n\nAs a hospital director, you are familiar with the literature surrounding hospital pandemic preparedness, and regularly read papers such as:\n\nMer, Mervyn et al. “Critical Care Pandemic Preparation: Considerations and Lessons Learned from COVID-19.” Critical care clinics vol. 38,4 (2022): 761-774.\nTacconelli, Evelina et al. “Challenges of data sharing in European Covid-19 projects: A learning opportunity for advancing pandemic preparedness and response.” The Lancet regional health.
